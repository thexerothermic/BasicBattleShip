# BasicBattleShip
A little text based game where you attempt to find the coordinates of enemy battleships.
All coordinates are reperesented by x and y integers.
If you miss, the euclidean distance between your guess and the closest enemy battleship is given.
Make sure all of the coordinates you enter are pairs of x and y values with x and y within the range of 0 to 99. An example input is as follows, the input being the text within the quotes. "50,50". During each round, your computer opponent has a 1/6th chance of hitting one of your battleships. When either the player or the computer has 0 battleships left, the round is over, and the player with battleships remaining is the victor. Running this program requires the host environment to have .Net 4.5 or later.
